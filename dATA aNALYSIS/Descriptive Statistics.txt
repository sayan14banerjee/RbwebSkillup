**Descriptive Statistics:**

* **Mean:** Average value
* **Median:** Middle value
* **Mode:** Most occurring value
* **Range:** Difference between maximum and minimum values
* **Standard deviation:** Measure of variability from the mean
* **Variance:** Square of the standard deviation

**Inferential Statistics (Hypothesis Testing):**

* **Null hypothesis:** Statement that there is no difference or relationship between two variables.
* **Alternative hypothesis:** Statement that there is a difference or relationship.
* **Significance level (alpha):** Probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (typically 0.05).
* **P-value:** Probability of observing the sample results if the null hypothesis is true.
* **Type I error (false positive):** Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
* **Type II error (false negative):** Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.
**Distribution **
* **Binolmial Distribution 
** Poissonal Distribution 
**Correlation:**

* **Pearson correlation coefficient (r):** Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

**Regression Analysis:**

* **Simple linear regression:** Models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable.
* **Multiple regression:** Models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.

**Time Series Analysis:**

* **Autocorrelation:** Correlation between values in a time series at different points in time.
* **Moving average:** Smoothes a time series by averaging over a specified window.
* **Exponential smoothing:** Uses past values to forecast future values with a declining weight assigned to older data.

**Machine Learning:**

* **Supervised learning:** Algorithms that learn from labeled data and make predictions.
* **Unsupervised learning:** Algorithms that learn patterns and structures from unlabeled data.
* **Common algorithms:** Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines

**Data Visualization:**

* **Bar charts:** Display categorical data as bars.
* **Line charts:** Plot data over time or other continuous variables.
* **Scatter plots:** Show the relationship between two continuous variables.
* **Histograms:** Visualize the distribution of a continuous variable.

**Data Management and Cleaning:**

* **Data cleaning:** Removing errors, inconsistencies, and outliers.
* **Data imputation:** Filling in missing values.
* **Data transformation:** Converting data to a different format or scale.
